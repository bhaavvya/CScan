# About CScanüîç
Welcome to the CScan. This tool allows you to analyze WhatsApp chats for various metrics like total messages, most active users,word cloud, activity maps and many more.
<br>
In addition, we have a Narcotics & CBI Section where the tool can search for suspicious words related to narcotics, drugs, cybercrime, and threats. The system also identifies the potential culprit who uses these sensitive words the most.
<br>
Features of this tool:
<br>
- View WhatsApp chat statistics
- Detect messages related to narcotics, drugs, cybercrime, and threats
- View flagged messages after clicking on the sensitive information button to prevent flashing harsh words to the users.
- Identify the potential culprit in the chat
