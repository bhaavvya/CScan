09/11/23, 8:08 pm - Asmi Kj: Hello once again
09/11/23, 8:08 pm - Asmi Kj: That test was so traumatizing 🥹
09/11/23, 8:09 pm - Asmi Kj: Barclays test was sooo much easier
09/11/23, 8:09 pm - Asmi Kj: The time was also so less 🥹
09/11/23, 8:09 pm - Asmi Kj: I think I only did 4/10 MCQs
09/11/23, 8:09 pm - Asmi Kj: Negative marking was also there 🥹
09/11/23, 8:10 pm - Asmi Kj: And..1/2 coding Q
09/11/23, 8:10 pm - Nic 🫀: dammm
09/11/23, 8:10 pm - Asmi Kj: First one was very easy,
Second one 1 only passed 1 test case out of 7 🥹😂
09/11/23, 8:10 pm - Asmi Kj: Even though I expected to pass 0 cause I hadn't written the main portion of the code
09/11/23, 8:11 pm - Asmi Kj: Cause I couldn't make up a logic for it 😔
09/11/23, 8:11 pm - Asmi Kj: I don't think I'll get selected 🥹
09/11/23, 8:11 pm - Asmi Kj: There are sooo many talented people here
09/11/23, 8:12 pm - Asmi Kj: From NITs and what not
09/11/23, 8:12 pm - Asmi Kj: Anyways ... I will seriously start doing DSA now
09/11/23, 8:13 pm - Nic 🫀: which questions were asked
09/11/23, 8:13 pm - Nic 🫀: like what type
09/11/23, 8:13 pm - Asmi Kj: In coding?
09/11/23, 8:13 pm - Nic 🫀: yeah
09/11/23, 8:14 pm - Asmi Kj: First one was to implement a deque
09/11/23, 8:14 pm - Asmi Kj: Second one was, a bit long
09/11/23, 8:16 pm - Anaya: Oh
09/11/23, 8:16 pm - Anaya: Its ok, at least u solved
09/11/23, 8:17 pm - Anaya: But they select clg wise anyway
09/11/23, 8:17 pm - Anaya: So still chances are there 🥳
09/11/23, 8:18 pm - Nic 🫀: yeah bruh ..u did ur best na
09/11/23, 8:18 pm - Nic 🫀: im  soooooo proud that u made it this far <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 8:19 pm - Nic 🫀: would be even prouder if u made it ahead
09/11/23, 8:24 pm - Asmi Kj: Person 1 has a chalk arrangement
Let's say 5 6 3 7
So the pattern is ↑↓↑ 
(5→6 increase, 6→3 decrease, 3→7 increase)

Person 2 has a chalk collection
Let's say 1 2 3 4
He has to arrange the chalks in the same pattern as Person 1
So he can arrange it in the following ways
1 3 2 4
1 4 2 3
2 3 1 4
2 4 1 3
(Idk if I left any)

Now out of these arrangements we have to pick the one which would give the maximum 'niceness' and print the value of max niceness
Niceness is calculated by adding the absolute difference of adjacent chalks
So for the above arrangements
|1-3| + |3-2| + |2-4| = 5
|1-4| + |4-2| + |2-3| = 6
|2-3|+ |3-1| + |1-4| = 6
|2-4| + |4-1| + |1-3| = 7
Since 7 is the max, 
So the output for this Q is 7
09/11/23, 8:24 pm - Asmi Kj: The second Q 🙂
09/11/23, 8:25 pm - Bhavya Verma: Yes asmi u gave ur best
09/11/23, 8:25 pm - Bhavya Verma: And time also matters
09/11/23, 8:26 pm - Asmi Kj: Thank u all of u 🥺🩷
For the constant support
09/11/23, 8:26 pm - Bhavya Verma: And baki ko bhi hard laga hoga
09/11/23, 8:28 pm - Asmi Kj: Instead of this dumb Q I should've focused on the MCQ 
I could've solved 2 more at least 🥹
Couldn't solve cause time over 🥺🥺
09/11/23, 8:29 pm - Bhavya Verma: Mcq were code given and output asking?
09/11/23, 8:30 pm - Asmi Kj: Oh and in MCQ
2 Qs were on PnC
2 C++ predict o/p
2 Java predict o/p
Then 3 Data structure Qs
1 Q on semaphores
09/11/23, 8:30 pm - Asmi Kj: I did both PnC
1 data structures
And the semaphores one
09/11/23, 8:31 pm - Asmi Kj: Other data structures waala I wasn't sure so I didn't write
Cuz Negative 🥹 <This message was edited>
09/11/23, 8:31 pm - Asmi Kj: And the predict o/p Qs had veryyyy long codes, I would've done it but the time finished 🥲 <This message was edited>

Greening the Economy: Lessons from Scandinavia	Lund University	BEGINNER	15.2	https://www.coursera.org/learn/greening-the-economy	How can we live a good life on one planet with over seven billion people? \n\nThis course will explore greening the economy on four levels – individual, business, city, and nation. We will look at the relationships between these levels and give many practical examples of the complexities and solutions across the levels. Scandinavia, a pioneering place advancing sustainability and combating climate change, is a unique starting point for learning about greening the economy. We will learn from many initiatives attempted in Scandinavia since the 1970s, which are all potentially helpful and useful for other countries and contexts.\n\nThe International Institute for Industrial Environmental Economics (IIIEE) at Lund University is an international centre of excellence on strategies for sustainable solutions. The IIIEE is ideally suited to understand and explain the interdisciplinary issues in green economies utilising the diverse disciplinary backgrounds of its international staff. The IIIEE has been researching and teaching on sustainability and greener economies since the 1990s and it has extensive international networks connecting with a variety of organizations.

Circular Economy - Sustainable Materials Management	Lund University, Delft University of Technology, EIT RawMaterials, Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland, Ghent University, National Technical University of Athens, VITO	BEGINNER	18.1	https://www.coursera.org/learn/circular-economy	This course looks at where important materials in products we use every day come from and how these materials can be used more efficiently, longer, and in closed loops. This is the aim of the Circular Economy, but it doesn’t happen on its own. It is the result of choices and strategies by suppliers, designers, businesses, policymakers and all of us as consumers. \n\nIn addition to providing many cases of managing materials for sustainability, the course also teaches skills and tools for analyzing circular business models and promotes development of your own ideas to become more involved in the transition to a Circular Economy.\n\nYou will learn from expert researchers and practitioners from around Europe as they explain core elements and challenges in the transition to a circular economy over the course of 5 modules:\n\nModule 1: Materials. This module explores where materials come from, and builds a rationale for why society needs more circularity. \n\nModule 2: Circular Business Models. In this module circular business models are explored in-depth and a range of ways for business to create economic and social value are discussed.\n\nModule 3: Circular Design, Innovation and Assessment. This module presents topics like functional materials and eco-design as well as methods to assess environmental impacts.\n\nModule 4: Policies and Networks. This module explores the role of governments and networks and how policies and sharing best practices can enable the circular economy.\n\nModule 5: Circular Societies. This module examines new norms, forms of engagement, social systems, and institutions, needed by the circular economy and how we, as individuals, can help society become more circular.\n\nThis course is brought to you by: \nLUND UNIVERSITY\nINTERNATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS (IIIEE)\nEIT RAWMATERIALS\nVITO\nGEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF DENMARK AND GREENLAND\nNATIONAL TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY OF ATHENS\nGHENT UNIVERSITY\nDELFT UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY	No Specialization	No Specialization	English	Physical Science and Engineering	Environmental Science and Sustainability	xPcHhsEbEeaXORK1gIKLbg	Yes	Yes	Always Available

29/11/23, 1:53 am - Asmi Kj: *Types of software product metrics*

1. Size-oriented:
Derived by normalizing quality and/or productivity measures by considering size of software produced
a) Errors per KLOC
b) Defects per KLOC
c) $ per LOC
d) Documentation pages per KLOC

Other:
e) Errors per person-month
f) LOC per person-month
g) $ per page of documentation
29/11/23, 1:53 am - Asmi Kj: Size = KLOC
Effort = Person/month
Productivity = KLOC/person-month
Quality = Number of faults/KLOC
Cost = $/KLOC
Documentation = Pages of docs/KLOC
29/11/23, 1:53 am - Asmi Kj: 2. Function-oriented:
Measure of functionality delivered by application
Function points derived from direct measures of information domain
a) User inputs: user input that provides distinct application oriented data to the software
b) User outputs: output that provides application oriented information to user (reports, screens, error messages)
c) User inquiries: on-line input that results in generation of some immediate software response in form of on-line output
d) Internal Logical Files(ILF): logical master file (logical grouping of data that may be part of large database or separate file)
e) External interfaces: Logical grouping of data that resides external to the application but provides information that may be of use to application

When simulated annealing is applied to the Discrete Hopfield
network then it becomes Boltzmann machine.

* When simulated annealing is applied to the Discrete Hopfield
* network then it becomes Boltzmann machine.
* Stochastic Neural Network: Boltzmann Machines are stochastic recurrent neural networks where neurons have binary states and stochastic activations.
* Energy-Based Model: Governed by an energy function, these machines model the compatibility of neuron states using the Boltzmann distribution.
* Neurons are fully connected bidirectionally, allowing for complex interactions and relationships.

01/12/23, 2:24 am - Asmi Kj: What to write in SVM
01/12/23, 2:25 am - Asmi Kj: No 😭
01/12/23, 2:25 am - Anaya: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful and widely used supervised machine learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks.

* Objective:
    * SVM aims to find a hyperplane that best separates data points into different classes. In a two-dimensional space, this hyperplane is a line; in higher-dimensional spaces, it becomes a hyperplane.
* Margin:
    * SVM focuses on maximizing the margin, which is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data points (support vectors) from each class.
    * Larger margins generally lead to better generalization performance on unseen data.
* Kernel Trick:
    * SVM can handle non-linearly separable data by mapping input features into a higher-dimensional space. This is done using kernel functions,
* Support Vectors:
    * Support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the decision boundary (hyperplane). These points are crucial in determining the optimal hyperplane and defining the margin.
* Classification and Regression:
    * SVM is primarily used for classification, where it separates data into distinct classes.
    * Support Vector Regression (SVR) is an adaptation of SVM for regression tasks, where it predicts a continuous output.
* Multiclass Classification:
    * SVM can be extended for multiclass classification using methods like one-vs-one or one-vs-all

01/12/23, 2:42 am - Anaya: Linear Separation:

The hyperplane is chosen such that it maximally separates the support vectors of different classes while maintaining a margin.
Support Vectors:

The support vectors are the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane and play a crucial role in defining the margin.
01/12/23, 2:42 am - Anaya: a hyperplane is a decision boundary that separates data points of different classes in feature space.
01/12/23, 2:42 am - Anaya: The margin in SVM refers to the distance between the decision boundary (hyperplane) and the data points that are closest to this boundary, known as support vectors.

07/12/23, 2:11 am - Nic 🫀: Sigh
07/12/23, 2:27 am - Asmi Kj: Sigh ×2
07/12/23, 4:40 am - Asmi Kj: Inverted paging was a concept introduced to reduce the memory space taken up by the page table
So especially in multi-process environments where each process would be having its own page table (and these page tables can be huge on their own), that would take up too much memory space, so in inverted paging we map the physical memory to the logical memory instead of the other way around in normal paging
Now the OS just has to maintain one paging table where we mention which process ka which page is present in this particular frame
07/12/23, 4:50 am - Asmi Kj: So the disadvantage here (which I forgot in the meet) is that since everything is scattered in the main memory, we have no idea which page will be present where, so we have to do a sequential exhaustive search, so in short we trade off access time with memory here
Less memory required, more access time needed
Whereas in normal paging (even hierarchical and hashed paging) we need more memory but less access time as we already know at what index we will find our frame number so we an directly go to that index
So there we'll need more memory but shorter access time
07/12/23, 4:52 am - Asmi Kj: And nowadays, memory is getting cheaper, time is more important to everyone
So even though inverted paging was introduced to lessen the memory load, it never became that popular due to its long access times
07/12/23, 9:39 am - Asmi Kj: Hello, who's awake?
What time do y'all want the meet to start
07/12/23, 9:39 am - Asmi Kj: Main Q is do you even want the meet to start  🥹

08/12/23, 1:51 pm - Bhavya Verma: The Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) model is a statistical method used in time series analysis. It combines autoregression (AR), which involves predicting future values based on past values, and moving average (MA), which incorporates the error term from previous predictions. ARMA models are valuable for understanding and forecasting sequential data, such as financial market prices or temperature fluctuations. The model's order, defined by p and q, represents the number of past observations considered for autoregression and moving average components, respectively. ARMA models provide a flexible framework for capturing patterns in time series data.

25/12/23, 2:51 pm - Nic 🫀: This is my song
25/12/23, 2:51 pm - Nic 🫀: Love's my religion but he was my faith
Something so sacred so hard to replace
Fallin' for him was like fallin' from grace
All wrapped in one he was so many sins
Would have done anything, everything for him
And if you ask me I would do it again
No need to imagine
'Cause I know it's true
They say, "All good boys go to heaven"
But bad boys bring heaven to you
It's automatic
It's just what they do
They say, "All good boys go to heaven"
But bad boys bring heaven to you
25/12/23, 2:57 pm - Bhavya Verma: Wow
25/12/23, 2:57 pm - Bhavya Verma: Wow

25/02/24, 5:43 pm - Asmi Kj: No
25/02/24, 5:43 pm - Asmi Kj: I didn't even complete 1 and 2 yet 🥹
25/02/24, 5:43 pm - Asmi Kj: Exam is at 11:45 na?
25/02/24, 7:26 pm - Anaya: Yes
27/02/24, 2:16 am - Asmi Kj: 1. Distinguish between vulnerability, threat, and control.

2. Theft usually results in some kind of harm. For example, if someone steals
your car, you may suffer financial loss, inconvenience (by losing your mode of
transportation), and emotional upset (because of invasion of your personal
property and space). List three kinds of harm a company might experience from
theft of computer equipment.

3. List at least three kinds of harm a company could experience from electronic
espionage or unauthorized viewing of confidential company materials.

4. List at least three kinds of damage a company could suffer when the integrity
of a program or company data is compromised.

5. List at least three kinds of harm a company could encounter from loss of
service, that is, failure of availability. List the product or capability to which
access is lost, and explain how this loss hurts the company.
27/02/24, 2:18 am - Asmi Kj: 6. Describe a situation in which you have experienced harm as a consequence of a failure of computer security. Was the failure malicious or not? Did the attack target you specifically or was it general and you were the unfortunate victim?

7. Describe two examples of vulnerabilities in automobiles for which auto manufacturers have instituted controls. Tell why you think these controls are effective, somewhat effective, or ineffective.

8. One control against accidental software deletion is to save all old versions of a program. Of course, this control is prohibitively expensive in terms of cost of storage. Suggest a less costly control against accidental software deletion. Is your control effective against all possible causes of software deletion? If not, what threats does it not cover?

9. On your personal computer, who can install programs? Who can change operating system data? Who can replace portions of the operating system? Can any of these actions be performed remotely?

10. Suppose a program to print paychecks secretly leaks a list of names of employees earning more than a certain amount each month. What controls could be instituted to limit the vulnerability of this leakage?
27/02/24, 2:19 am - Asmi Kj: 11. Preserving confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data is a restatement of the concern over interruption, interception, modification, and fabrication. How do the first three concepts relate to the last four? That is, is any of the four equivalent to one or more of the three? Is one of the three encompassed by one or more of the four?

12. Do you think attempting to break in to (that is, obtain access to or use of) a computing system without authorization should be illegal? Why or why not?

13. Describe an example (other than the ones mentioned in this chapter) of data whose confidentiality has a short timeliness, say, a day or less. Describe an example of data whose confidentiality has a timeliness of more than a year.

14. Do you currently use any computer security control measures? If so, what? Against what attacks are you trying to protect?

15. Describe an example in which absolute denial of service to a user (that is, the user gets no response from the computer) is a serious problem to that user. Describe another example where 10 percent denial of service to a user (that is, the user’s computation progresses, but at a rate 10 percent slower than normal) is a serious problem to that user. Could access by unauthorized people to a computing system result in a 10 percent denial of service to the legitimate users? How?
27/02/24, 2:20 am - Asmi Kj: 16. When you say that software is of high quality, what do you mean? How does security fit in your definition of quality? For example, can an application be insecure and still be “good”?

17. Developers often think of software quality in terms of faults and failures. Faults are problems (for example, loops that never terminate or misplaced commas in statements) that developers can see by looking at the code. Failures are problems, such as a system crash or the invocation of the wrong function, that are visible to the user. Thus, faults can exist in programs but never become failures, because the conditions under which a fault becomes a failure are never reached. How do software vulnerabilities fit into this scheme of faults and failures? Is every fault a
vulnerability? Is every vulnerability a fault?

18. Consider a program to display on your website your city’s current time and temperature. Who might want to attack your program? What types of harm might they want to cause? What kinds of vulnerabilities might they exploit to cause harm?

19. Consider a program that allows consumers to order products from the web. Who might want to attack the program? What types of harm might they want to cause? What kinds of vulnerabilities might they exploit to cause harm?

20. Consider a program to accept and tabulate votes in an election. Who might want to attack the program? What types of harm might they want to cause? What kinds of vulnerabilities might they exploit to cause harm?

21. Consider a program that allows a surgeon in one city to assist in an operation on a patient in another city via an Internet connection. Who might want to attack the program? What types of harm might they want to cause? What kinds of vulnerabilities might they exploit to cause harm?
